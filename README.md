SACL
====

Smart ACL (Access Control List) is meant to be a base to my personal Codeigniter (PHP) web application development. Stem from the frustation of my own incompetencies in using other ACL and unsatisfying urge to try some weird stuff in Codeigniter, SACL is now released to the world.

REQUIREMENT
===========

- PHP

INSTALL
=======

1- Copy the whole folder into new folder under public html
2- Create new database and import tables from /migrate_ssacl.sql
3- Make sure your database setting is correct.
4- Login root user with as username "root@gmail.com" and password "qwerty123"
